1. If a class is declared without any access modifiers, where may the class be accessed?

A class that is declared without any access modifiers is said to have package or default access.
 This means that the class can only be accessed by other classes and interfaces that are defined within 
the same package.


2 .  Does a class inherit the constructors of its superclass?

A class does not inherit constructors from any of its super classes


3. Which java.util classes and interfaces support event handling?

The EventObject class and the EventListener interface support event processing

4.    What is the purpose of the Runtime class?

The purpose of the Runtime class is to provide access to the Java runtime system.
It returns the runtime information like memory availability.

* Runtime.freeMemory() –> Returns JVM Free Memory
* Runtime.maxMemory() –> Returns the maximum amount of memory that the JVM will attempt to use.
 It also helps to run the garbage collector
* Runtime.gc()



5.    Can an unreachable object become reachable again?

An unreachable object may become reachable again. This can happen when the object’s finalize() method is
 invoked and the object performs an operation which causes it to become accessible to reachable object


6.    What is the functionality of instanceOf() ?
instanceOf opertaor is used to check whether an object can be cast to a specific type without throwing
 ClassCastException.


7 . What would happen if you say this = null?

It will come up with Error Message

“The left-hand side of an assignment must be a variable”.


8  . I want to create two instances of a class ,But when trying for creating third instance it should not allow me to create .
 What i have to do for making this?


9.   Why default constructor of base class will be called first in java?

A subclass inherits all the methods and fields (eligible one) from the base class, so base class is constructed in the process
 of creation of subclass object (subclass is also an object of superclass). Hence before initializing the default value of sub 
class the super class should be initialized using the default constructor.


10.  What are the other ways to create an object other than creating as new object?

We can create object in different ways;

1.new operator

2.class.forName: Classname obj = Class.forName(“Fully Qualified class Name”).newInstance();

3.newInstance

4.object.clone



11 .  What is the difference between instance, object, reference and a class?

Class: A class is a user defined data type with set of data members & member functions

Object: An Object is an instance of a class

Reference: A reference is just like a pointer pointing to an object

Instance: This represents the values of data members of a class at a particular time


12.  Can we force JVM to run garbage collection?

No. We cannot force instead we can request JVM to run a garbage collection


13.  Explain which type of variables will go in heap and  which type in stack?

All the instance variables (references) and any objects (local or instance) will reside under heap and local variables (references) will go in stack.


14.	How we can request Garbage Collection request?

There are two ways to request Garbage Collector-

Runtime.getRuntime().gc()
System.gc()
