Exception:



1.	What are different scenarios causing “Exception in thread main”?

ans: 	Some of the common main thread exception scenarios are:
	Exception in thread main java. lang. UnsupportedClassVersionError: 
	This exception comes when your java class is compiled from another JDK 
	version and you are trying to run it from another java version.



2	What is OutOfMemoryError in Java?

ans:		OutOfMemoryError exception. Usually, this error is thrown when there is insufficient 
		space to allocate an object in the Java heap. In this case, The garbage collector cannot 
		make space available to accommodate a new object, and the heap cannot be expanded further. 
		Also, this error may be thrown when there is insufficient native memory to support the loading 
		of a Java class.



3. What is the difference between ClassNotFoundException and NoClassDefFoundError?
	
ans:		Both these exceptions occur when ClassLoader or JVM is not able to find classes while loading during run-time.
		
		 However, the difference between these 2 are: 

		ClassNotFoundException: This exception occurs when we try to load a class that is not found in the classpath at runtime 
		by making use of the loadClass() or Class.forName() methods.
		NoClassDefFoundError: This exception occurs when a class was present at compile-time but was not found at runtime



4. What do you understand by an unreachable catch block error?
	
ans:		This error is thrown by the compiler when we have multiple catch blocks and keep parent classes 
		first and subclasses later. The catch blocks should follow the order of the most specific ones at
		 the top to the most general ones at the bottom. If this is not followed, an unreachable catch block
		 error is thrown during compile time.



4. Is it possible to throw checked exceptions from a static block?

ans : 		We cannot throw a check exception from a static block. However, we can have try-catch logic that handles 
		the exception within the scope of that static block without rethrowing the exception using the throw keyword.
		The exceptions cannot be propagated from static blocks because static blocks are invoked at the compiled time 
		only once and no method invokes these blocks.



6. What are different scenarios where “Exception in thread main” types of error could occur?
	The following are some of the scenarios causing an exception in the main thread:

		1. Exception in thread main java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: 
			This occurs when the Java class is compiled from one JDK version and we run the class in another JDK version.
		
		2. Exception in thread main java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main: This occurs when we try to run a class that has no main method.
		
		3. Exception in thread main java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: This occurs if a ClassLoader is unable to find that class in the 
		   classpath at the time of loading it.
		
		4. Exception in thread “main” java.lang.ArithmeticException: 
		   This is an example exception. Here, in the logic, ArithmeticException was thrown from the main method due to 
		 some erroneous logic in the main or due to the methods called from the main that threw this exception but was not handled there.
